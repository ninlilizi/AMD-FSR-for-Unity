# AMD FSR (Fidelity Super Resolution) for Unity.

#### For Standard Pipeline
Implimented as an image effect.
* Add FSR_StandardPipeline.cs to your camera.
* It must be the first effect on the camera.
* If you use post-effects reliant on deferred or depth buffers, enable 'Copy Render Buffers' to pass them through.


Enjoy using this as an example for integration into your Unity projects!
